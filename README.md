It works like a choose-your-own-adventure game. A story unfolds in chapters (nodes), and at the end of each scene you make choices that lead to different paths and endings.

The story content is stored in a story tree, where each node has:

Text (scene description)

Choices (which path to take next)

Extra details like mood and AI image prompts

The app has features like:

Achievements when you reach special endings

Statistics tracking (choices made, time spent, progress)

Undo & Restart to explore new paths

Export/Import of the story tree (JSON or text)

Story crafting tools to add your own scenes and branches

Mood-based styling and visuals for immersion
